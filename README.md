## Why? 

I'm studying machine learning and found Martin's article [here](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/rules-of-ml/).
I liked its content and hierarchical nature. Was curious to turn it
into visualization, and came up with this hierarchical tree-chart

Turns out there is a name for this visualization type: [SunBurst](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/sunburst/)

The entire visualization code is [here](https://github.com/anvaka/rules-of-ml/blob/master/get-sunburst-path.js).
It is raw javascript, and it doesn't use any third-party libraries.
