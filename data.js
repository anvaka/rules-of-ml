First, the transition to a machine\n learned system will be smoother. Second, usually those rules contain a lot of the intuition about the \n system you don\u2019t want to throw away. There are four ways you can use an existing heuristic:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Preprocess using the heuristic. If the feature is incredibly awesome, then this is an option.

This approach makes the most sense in binary classification tasks.</li>\n<li>Create a feature. Directly creating a feature from the heuristic is great. For example, if you use a heuristic to compute a relevance score for a query result, you can include the score as the value of a feature. Later on you may want to use machine learning techniques to massage the value (for example, converting the value into one of a finite set of discrete values, or combining it with other features) but start by using the raw value produced by the heuristic.</li>\n<li>Mine the raw inputs of the heuristic. If there is a heuristic for apps that combines the number of installs, the number of characters in the text, and the day of the week, then consider pulling these pieces apart, and feeding these inputs into the learning separately. Some techniques that apply to ensembles apply here (see <a href=\'#\' data-path=\'0:3:0:2\'>Rule #40</a>).</li>\n<li>Modify the label. This is an option when you feel that the heuristic captures information not currently contained in the label.

There is a lot of leeway here. See <a href=\'#\' data-path=\'0:1:2\'>"Your First Objective"</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nDo be mindful of the added complexity when using heuristics in an ML system.

However, an ensemble of models (a\n      "model" which combines the scores of other models) can work better. <strong>To keep\n      things simple, each model should either be an ensemble only taking the input of\n      other models, or a base model taking many features, but not both.</strong> If you have\n      models on top of other models that are trained separately, then combining them\n      can result in bad behavior.</p>\n      <p>Use a simple model for ensembling that takes only the output of your "base"\nmodels as inputs. You also want to enforce properties on these ensemble models.\nFor example, an increase in the score produced by a base model should not\ndecrease the score of the ensemble. Also, it is best if the incoming models are\nsemantically interpretable (for example, calibrated) so that changes of the\nunderlying models do not confuse the ensemble model. Also, <strong>enforce that an\nincrease in the predicted probability of an underlying classifier does not\ndecrease the predicted probability of the ensemble</strong>.</p>' }, { name: 'Rule #41: When performance plateaus, look for qualitatively new sources of information to add rather than refining existing signals.',

          html: '\n      <p>Diversity in a set of content can mean many things, with the diversity of the\nsource of the content being one of the most common.

To personalize, they add\nfeatures that would allow the system to personalize (some features representing\nthe user\u2019s interest) or diversify (features indicating if this document has any\nfeatures in common with other documents returned, such as author or content),\nand find that those features get less weight (or sometimes a different sign)\nthan they expect.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean that diversity, personalization, or relevance aren\u2019t valuable.\nAs pointed out in the previous rule, you can do post\xADprocessing to increase\ndiversity or relevance.
